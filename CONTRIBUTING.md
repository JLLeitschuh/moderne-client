This project use `tox` to run tests and linting.

Currently, IntelliJ and PyCharm only support `tox` version 3.x.
This will be fixed in the next release of IntelliJ and PyCharm, until then, you will need to install `tox` version 3.x manually.
See: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-57956

To run all tests and linting, run:

```bash
tox
```
